    <h1>Marguerite Blair</h1>
    <p>Marguerite Blair was born in Boston, MA on October 3rd, 1998. After abandoning her longtime dream of becoming a cartographer, she decided to take up coding, a much more lucrative and interesting field. In her spare time, she likes looking at dogs, eating burritos, and learning new languages. She hopes that by the time she is 25, she will speak Spanish, English, Portuguese, and Japanese fluently.</p>
